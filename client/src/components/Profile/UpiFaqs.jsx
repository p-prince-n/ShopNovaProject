    question: "Why does ShopNova save my UPI details?",
    answer:
      "Saving your UPI ID helps speed up checkout. Instead of typing your UPI every time, you can simply choose your saved UPI ID while making a payment. This makes the process faster and still keeps it secure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is storing my UPI information on ShopNova safe?",
    answer:
      "Yes, itâ€™s completely safe. Your UPI ID is stored securely and is non-confidential information. ShopNova does not keep sensitive PCI data, so your details remain protected.",
  },
  {
    question: "What UPI details are actually stored by ShopNova?",
    answer:
      "ShopNova only saves your UPI ID and payment provider information. Sensitive data like your UPI PIN or MPIN is never stored.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I allowed to remove my saved UPI details?",
    answer:
      "Of course! You can delete your UPI ID from your ShopNova account whenever you want.",
  },
